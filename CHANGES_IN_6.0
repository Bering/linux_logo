==============
Changes in 6.0
==============

+ bumped to libsysinfo 0.3.0
	-> redone x86/x86_64 detection
	-> redone arm detection (handles big/LITTLE now)
	-> add arm64/aarch64 support
	-> add riscv support
+ various minor tweaks to try to fit sysinfo on screen better
+ try to more gracefully handle lack of Bogomips (most notably removed on ARM)
+ properly fallback to meminfo memory detection, as iomem is useless on
	modern systems and stat /proc/kcore gives crazy results on
	64-bit systems
+ new logos:
	+ 1930 Model 15 Teletype
	+ Devuan
	+ Blankon

==============
Changes in 5.0
==============

+ The build system has changed. 
  You now need to run ./configure before running make
+ Cross-compiling is now possible (see the README)  
+ getopt() is no longer used to parse command line options.
  Please report any bugs that might be caused by this.
+ The i18n support was re-worked.  Please try it out.
+ A large amount of code was re-written from scratch.
  Let me know of any regressions.
+ The loadaverage options now don't print times
  with 0 in them (i.e., it will print "2 days 1 minute"
  instead of "2 days 0 hours 1 minute")
+ You can now specify logos by name, rather than number.
  Maintainers please take note, this is now the preferred
    way of specifying logos.

     by Vince Weaver (vince@deater.net, http://www.deater.net/weave )

   SUPPORTS Linux (all but s390, SH, cris) and some non-Linux OS's
\*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

I have released version 4.0 of my linux_logo package.  

A sample ascii output is attached to the end.  

NEW IN VERSION 4.0
  -- new config file system
  -- lots of bug fixes
  -- ia64 support
  -- Internationalization code
  -- Additional banners
  -- Reorganized documentation
  -- Complete overhaul of sysinfo code
  -- optional assembly-language version
  -- Re-wrote logo_generation code
  -- Any amount of custom logos can be compiled in
  -- Removal of some old options
  -- Addition of ARM architecture
  -- All kinds of fixes and tweaks.
  -- Smaller executable!

DESCRIPTION
  -- linux_logo outputs a color ansi version of a penguin, accompanied by
     system info gathered from proc.
  
FEATURES
  -- Works great on standard Linux systems
  -- Works on almost all Linux architectures and a few other non-linux os's
  -- Modular: easy to change the logo that gets displayed
  -- Lots of command-line options to tweak the display
  -- Raw ASCII output for those wanting simplicity/dumb terminal output.

USES [instructions included]
  -- Have a boot-up penguin in userspace [avoid kernel bloat]
  -- Impress your friends with a fancy color penguin login/motd
  -- Have a "penguin" port on your computer
  -- Use the "sysinfo-only" option to display info in SSI or cgi-scripts.
  -- Use your imagination!
